Installation and Setup
Backend Setup

    Navigate to the backend directory:

    bash

cd backend

Install the necessary dependencies:

bash

npm install

Start the backend server:

bash

    node server.js

    The server will run on http://localhost:5000.

Frontend Setup

    Navigate to the frontend directory:

    bash

cd frontend

Install the necessary dependencies:

bash

npm install

Start the frontend development server:

bash

    npm start

    The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000.

Usage

    Once both servers are running, open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to access the dashboard.
    The dashboard will automatically fetch and display real-time data from the backend, including CI/CD status and server metrics.

Customization

    CI/CD Status Service: Modify ciCdService.js in the backend to fetch real data from your CI/CD pipeline.
    Server Metrics Service: Update serverMonitoringService.js to pull real server metrics, or integrate with third-party monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana.
